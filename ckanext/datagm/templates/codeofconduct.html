      {% block about %}
        <p>Part of the reason for putting DataGM together is for developers to
        make <a href="http://www.data.gov.uk/apps">applications</a> to provide
        more or improved utility for the general public based on public sector
        datasets. We are here to help you as developers do the great things we
        hope you are planning to do, but, as part of this being a trusted space
        in which we work together, there are some basic rules.</p>

        <p>You are <strong>encouraged to:</strong></p>

        <ul>

        <li>use provided live sources for the datasets as your primary data
        source, where possible much of the data provided will be dynamic and
        fluid (although in many cases over an annual or longer period of time),
        and basing your application on the keys in the data we are providing
        will ensure that your application is as up to date as possible;</li>

        <li>where using our data feeds, please if possible cache the data over
        a short period of time to reduce load both on your application and our
        servers;</li>

        <li>where you cannot use our live sources as the primary data source,
        please still use the keys contained within the data as the primary or
        foreign keys within your application, as this will enable you to
        migrate as simply as possible to up-to-date data and information when
        it is made available;</li>

        <li>where using your own long-term caches of our data, please refresh
        the data within your application in a timely manner when a new set of
        the data is made available;</li>

        <li>engage with us when something is wrong and please point out any
        inconsistencies in the data you find, make suggestions about how to
        improve the service, request new data sources to be added, and tell us
        about what you have built so we can help you to promote it!</li>

        </ul>

        <p>You <strong>should:</strong></p>

        <ul>

        <li>refer back to and cite the origin or source of the data when using
        it;</li>

        <li>clearly state where possible about which data is derived from
        official sources, which is from other sources, and which data is from
        any calculation within or outwith your app.</li>

        </ul>

        <p>You <strong>must not:</strong></p>

        <ul>

        <li>make an application that pretends to be an official government
        service;</li>

        <li>present the data in a misleading or incorrect manner or to
        misrepresent or change the data;</li>

        <li>use this site for party political purposes, as the site paid for
        with public money so it is not appropriate to engage in party-political
        activity here;</li>

        <li>use these materials in or to support a criminal or illicit
        activity;</li>

        <li>use these materials on an application to inflame or make comments
        that are racist, sexist or homophobic, or which promote or incite
        violence or illegal activity.</li>

        </ul>
